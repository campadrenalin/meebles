# The Layman's Guide to Meebles

*A friendly allegorical introduction to cryptocurrencies*

What is Bitcoin? It's a decentralized store of value money peer-to-peer concurrency. It's the future, and you should buy some! Also the price fluctuates wildly, and the CEO got hacked and committed suicide at the top of Mt. Gox in Japan. Did I mention it's programmable email of the early internet? Escrow!

Let's face it, this stuff is hard to describe, and equally hard for people to understand. Especially people who assume they're too old to "get it."

Well, don't sell yourself, or your grandparents, short too soon. Sure, there are detaily things that are really esoteric - not everybody's gonna go learn the scripting language - but the basics aren't as hard as it seems, if you have a sufficient analogy. Anybody can learn the basics of cryptocurrencies, at a level that's actually meaningful for life decisions. All you need is an explanation that fits the way you think.

*The Layman's Guide to Meebles* is an attempt to explain cryptomoney in a way that fits onto people's basic intuitions, with enough of a cute factor to make it approachable. Less technobabble, more Tamagotchi trading. Hopefully, this will be a useful analogy for most people, but don't worry if it doesn't work for you - everyone thinks in different patterns, so down the road, some other explanation might make everything click for you - "oh my god, it's like X, only Y!"

If you're wondering just what all this Dogecoin mumbo-jumbo is about, pull up a chair and start thinking in Meebles.

And yes, you will be so utterly, *completely* sick of that word by the time you're done. Sorry in advance.
